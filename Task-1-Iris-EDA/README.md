# Task 1: Iris Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Objective
Explore and visualize the Iris dataset to understand its structure, distributions, and relationships between variables.

## Approach
- Load dataset using pandas from CSV
- Inspect dataset using `.shape`, `.columns`, `.head()`
- Visualize data:
  - Scatter plot for feature relationships (Seaborn)
  - Histogram for data distribution (Matplotlib)
  - Box plot for outliers and spread (Seaborn)

## Results & Insights
- The dataset is clean with no missing values.
- Petal length and width effectively separate species.
- Scatter and box plots reveal clear differences between species.
- Histogram shows the spread and distribution of individual features.

## Note
No data cleaning or model training was required for this task.
